# Platy

Platy is a plateform-independant api to use features commonly found on various
plateforms, notably mobile ones, in python.

## How

Platy tries not te reinvent the wheel, and will call for external libraries to
implement the api in the easiest way, depending on the current plateform.

- on python-for-android, pyjnius is used
- on kivy-ios, pyobjius is used
- on windows/mac/linux, commonly found libraries will be used

## todo

- everything! :)
